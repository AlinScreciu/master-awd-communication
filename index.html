  <!-- Introduction Section -->

    <h2 class="section-header">Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Communication derives from the Latin word <q>communicare</q>, meaning
      <q>to share</q> or <q>to make common</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is broadly understood as the <span class="emp">transmission of information</span>
      from a sender to a receiver through various mediums, such as speech,
      writing, body language, or technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, communication involves encoding, transmitting, and decoding
      messages, often to share meaning or foster understanding.

          <p>
            Interpersonal communication is the exchange of messages between individuals.
            It can happen face-to-face or virtually, enabling people to build relationships,
            share emotions, and resolve conflicts.

          <h4>Intrapersonal Communication</h4>
          <p>
            Intrapersonal communication occurs within oneself, involving self-reflection,
            internal dialogue, and emotional processing. It helps clarify thoughts
            and guide decision-making.

            Cultural communication explores how shared beliefs, customs,
            and values shape interactions. It fosters understanding
            across diverse groups while emphasizing the importance
            of context and norms.

            Nonverbal communication conveys meaning through gestures, facial expressions,
            posture, and tone. It complements or replaces verbal communication,
            adding depth and emotion to interactions.

            Plants communicate by releasing chemicals to signal danger
            or attract pollinators. For example, volatile compounds
            can warn neighboring plants of herbivore attacks.

    <p>
      To explore different perspectives, I spoke with a family member, a co-worker,
      and a friend to find out what communication means to them.
    </p>

    <div class="cards-wrapper">
      <!-- Perspective 1 -->
      <article class="context-card">
        <h4>A Family Member</h4>
        <blockquote>
          "For me, communication is about nurturing relationships and making sure
          everyone feels heard and understood."
        </blockquote>
      </article>

        </blockquote>

      <!-- Perspective 3 -->
      <article class="context-card">

  <!-- Creative Experimentation -->

    <h2 class="section-header">Creative Experimentation</h2>
    <p>
      In this section, I’ve explored how communication can extend beyond words, using visuals,
      symbols, colors, and interactive elements to convey different messages.
    </p>

    <div class="cards-wrapper">
      <!-- Experiment: Color Block -->
      <article class="context-card">
        <h4>Color Block Experiment</h4>
        <p>
          In this experiment, I used simple shapes and colors to show how different tones
          can evoke various emotions or messages, even without text.
        </p>
        <div class="color-blocks">
          <!-- Circle in warm color -->
          <div class="color-shape circle-warm"></div>
          <!-- Square in cool color -->
          <div class="color-shape square-cool"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          By simply changing the shape and hue, the viewer might feel a different emotional response—
          warmth, excitement, or calmness—even though these blocks don’t contain any words.

      <!-- Experiment: Captioned vs. Uncaptioned Image -->

        <p>
          One photo is shown twice. On the left, it’s captioned with a playful message,
          while on the right, it has no caption, inviting viewers to create their own meaning.

      <!-- Experiment: Hover Reveal -->
      <article class="context-card">
        <h4>Hover Reveal</h4>
        <p>
          Hover over the shape below to reveal a hidden message,
          illustrating how communication can be layered or obscured.

          <!-- The hidden message -->
          <div class="hover-message">
            Hidden message: "Context shapes interpretation."
          </div>
        </div>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p>
      Through these experiments, I found that communication relies as much on visual cues, context,
      and perception as it does on spoken or written words. Each piece challenged me to think
      more deeply about how messages are formed, shared, and interpreted.

  <!-- Final Section: Your Own Understanding -->
  <section class="section" id="my-understanding">
    <h2 class="section-header">My Understanding of Communication</h2>
    <p>
      After exploring various contexts, derivative forms, creative experiments,
      and interviewing people close to me, I’ve consolidated my personal insights
      on what communication means—both outwardly and inwardly.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Communication</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve realized that communication isn’t solely about exchanging words
      with others; it also begins with how we communicate with ourselves.
      Reflecting on my own thoughts and emotions helps me understand the
      intentions behind my words before I speak them. When I become more
      aware of my feelings and motivations, I can convey them in a clearer,
      more empathetic way.
    </p>

    <h3>Expressiveness and Adaptability</h3>
    <p>
      I also believe communication is an evolving skill. It’s not only
      about what we say, but how we listen, adapt our message, and interpret
      the signals—both verbal and nonverbal—of those around us. This adaptive
      quality encourages genuine connections, as it acknowledges that no
      two interactions are ever exactly the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, communication thrives at the intersection of self-awareness
      and empathy. By looking inward first and then listening carefully to
      others, we can create a continuous feedback loop that leads to deeper
      understanding and more meaningful relationships.
